Confidential Information, as used in this Agreement, shall mean any information or data which (a) if in tangible form or other media can be converted to readable form, is clearly marked as proprietary, confidential or private when disclosed, (b) if oral or visual, is identified as proprietary, confidential, or private at the time of disclosure, or (c) is of a nature or is disclosed under circumstances such that a reasonable person would consider it confidential.

7.2. A Disclosing Party's Confidential Information shall not include information that (a) is or becomes part of the public domain through no act or omission of a Receiving Party; (b) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure and had not been obtained by the Receiving Party from the Disclosing Party; (c) is disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party not known to the Receiving Party, following reasonable inquiry, to be subject to an obligation of non-disclosure with respect to such information; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.

7.3. The Receiving Party agrees to hold in confidence and not to disclose or reveal to any person or entity the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, and not to use the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information for any purpose other than in connection with the parties' discussions regarding, and performance of, a transaction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall not disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any of the Receiving Party's employees or agents, except those employees or agents who are required to have such Confidential Information to participate in the parties' discussions regarding, or performance of, a transaction, and who are under a written obligation of confidentiality or nondisclosure to the Receiving Party.

7.5. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that, due to the unique nature of Confidential Information, there can be no adequate remedy at law for breach of this Agreement and that such breach would cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party. The Disclosing Party shall thus be entitled to seek immediate injunctive relief, in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law or in equity, in the event of an actual or threatened breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party.

7.6. Confidential Information shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Disclosing Party.
