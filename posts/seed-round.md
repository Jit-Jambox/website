We are excited to announce our $ 1.1 million seed funding led by leading gaming investor,  [Ludus Venture Studio](https://www.luduscorp.com/) , along with other seasoned angel investors. With this,  [Ismet Goksen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismetgoksen/) , Managing Partner, Ludus Venture Studio, and an industry veteran joins our board. 

In our  [last blog post](https://jambox.games/2021/04/13/why-we-are-building-jambox/) , we talked about a huge market opportunity in emerging Asia with Indie developers and what we are trying to accomplish with Jambox Games. In Ludus Venture Studio, we have found the best partner to join us in this mission. 

Volkan Bicer, partner at Ludus Venture Studio has the following to share about Jambox Games: “We are extremely excited to participate in the fast-growing gaming market of SEA and India. Gaming is now established as mainstream entertainment. Vikas is a rare talent with visionary leadership and great execution capabilities. Jambox Games is solving a real developer pain point for emerging markets like India and Southeast Asia. With its unique “East to West’’ focus of bringing titles from emerging Southeast Asia to the western markets, Jambox Games has the ability to emerge as a market leader”. 

Ludus Venture Studio has an impeccable reputation in gaming as an investor and also has a very successful track record with the exit of Rollic Games to Zynga, Mobilike to AdColony. As a partner, they bring tremendous value in terms of learning and execution playbook in gaming and vast experience in Product development, User Acquisition, and Design. More importantly, we love their ‘founder first’ approach, which arises from their current entrepreneurial journey.  

While this capital validates our thesis around the challenges faced by mobile game developers, it also provides fuel to our ambition of building an independent platform that can power developers and their games to compete at the global level.
